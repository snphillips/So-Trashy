# Project 4: So Trashy

## Project Description
*So Trashy* uses data visualization to respresent New York City's Department of Sanitation's (DSNY) montly collection of refuse and recycling.

DSNY collects residential refuse, empties street litter baskets, cleans up abandoned property such as cars, tires and bycicles and occationally collects other types of refuse, such as clean-up post Superstorm Sandy. It does not pick up commercial refuse from offices, shops, other businesses or construction sites. DSNY publishes montly reports detailing how many tons of refuse and recycling has been collected, categorized by borough and further categorized into Community District (CD). The city is segmented into 59 CDs and each is serviced by their own sanitation garage.
